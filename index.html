            <h4>Isabella</h4>
            <p>
                I became a Father May 26<sup>th</sup> 2017 when my daughter Isabella was born. Isabella was born through a C-section after 27 hours of labor. <br>According to Isabella, these are her favorite things:
                <ul>
                    <li>Unicorns</li>
                    <li>princesses</li>
                    <li>Tomatoes with lasonic(balsamic)</li>
                    <li>Avocados</li>
                </ul>
                She has a wonderful imagination and an incredible desire to learn, I know this because she asks me "why" about a thousand times per day. Isabella started Kindergarten this year and has enjoyed every day of it.
                She continues to learn and grow every day, making both of her parents proud.

            <h4>Bennett</h4>
            <p>
                Bennett was born april 19<sup>th</sup> via c-section. Bennett is definitely the more wild of the two kids, he is constantly running around acting crazy and getting himself into trouble.
                While Bennett definitely shares his sisters curiousity, his differing trait is his shyness. Bennett is more of a cuddlebug in public but an absolute wild child when comfortable.<br>
                According to Bennett his favorite things are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Dinosaurs</li>
                    <li>Sharks</li>
                    <li>Daddy(I may have suggested this one)</li>
                </ul>
                Bennett loves the outdoors and getting dirty, especially when it comes to digging up worms. He has a kind soul and is well loved by everyone.
