            <h4>Maintenance</h4>
            <p>
                Currently I work as an Industrial Maintenance Technician and Waste Water Support Technician at a textile plant in Illinois.
                I've been in the industry since Feb' 2019 and have learned a great deal about the many challenges that a maintenance department faces.
                This career has challenged me both metnally and physically as i navigate the intricate problems associated with process automation.
                Here are a few among the many skills that I have learned:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fabrication</li>
                    <li>Electrical Diagnostics</li>
                    <li>Mechanical Diagnostics</li>
                    <li>Project Management</li>
                </ul>
            </p> 
            <h4>Automotive</h4>
            <p>
                I began my journey into the automotive industry when I enrolled in the Automotive Technology course in 2012. I began working at one of the largest aftermarket 
                automotive repair companies in the world. This gave me all the tools I needed to succeed and allowed me a fruitful career in automotive. During my time in the industry 
                I was fortunate enough to work my way from the bottom of the food-chain to the top. I started as a Lube-Tech and ended my time there as Lead Technician. In a short 5 years
                I went from only doing oil-changes and tires to diagnosing the most difficult trouble codes and custom wiring entire (classic) vehicles. 
                <h4>Certificates:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><abbr title="Automotive Service Excellence">ASE</abbr> Master Certified Technician</li>
                    <li>Timken Bearing Maintenance Certification</li>
